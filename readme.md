Air Waybill Number
Enter the eight digit Air Waybill number (including the Mod-7 check digit)


The check digit is derived by dividing the 7 digit Serial Number by 7. 
The remainder determines the Check Digit. 

Example: Serial Number 8114074 divided by 7 is 1159153 with remainder 3. 
To easily calculate the remainder you can divide the 7 figures by 7, then subtract it with its integer, 

i.e. 
    8114074 divided by 7 = 1159153.428571429; 
    1159153.428571429 - 1159153 = 0.428571429; 

multiply the result by 7 and you will get the check digit by rounding it up or down to its closest integer. 
Here 0.428571429 x 7 = 3,000.... therefore the Serial Number + Check Digit is 81140743.[6]
